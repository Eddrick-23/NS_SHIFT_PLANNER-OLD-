# [NS SHIFT PLANNER](https://nsplanner.streamlit.app/)

# Project Revamp Notice!

This Project has been revamped in a new project https://github.com/Eddrick-23/NS-Shift-Planner
- Future support will continue only for the revamped project
- This current app will still be kept available

## Updates
Update 0.1.0 (13/11/24)
- Replaced name selection for shift allocation to be a multi select widget
- Users can now allocate shifts to more than one person at a time
- Fixed minor exception handling during app running process

Update 0.2.0 (19/11/24)
- Added feature to rename a name across all databases
- Added feature to swap names within databases on the same day
- Added option to move hour count grid to the sidebar
- Hour count grid now displays in descending order by total hours, by defualt

Update 0.3.0 (7/12/24)
- Fixed bug where dataframes would appear stretched when the hide toggle is enabled.
- Added option to disable lunch and dinner break checks.

Update 1.0.0 (30/12/24)
- Added undo and redo feature
- Added option to allow shift validation to ignore overallocation(i.e. more than 4 people mounting at once).
- Changed behavior of full shift allocation
    - When either half of the hour is allocated, allocating a full shift will now allocate the full hour.
    - Allocating a full shift when the full hour is allocated will then deallocate the entire hour.
    - Note that the location of the already allocated half will be overriden to the currently set location.
        > **_Example:_**  
        [HCC1][] -(full allocation,location = MCC)-> [MCC][MCC] <br>
        [MCC][MCC] -(full allocation)-> [][]
- Button groups for shift allocation now toggle between disabled and active state. They are only redrawn when a different set of button groups are required.
- Added option for d2 to start at 0700 hrs. Note that the 0600 - 0700 time block will only be hidden when there are no shifts allocated in that time block. (This is for formatting purposes)
- Added name pool to allow adding and removing names from a common name pool. This is so that users only need to type the names once. **Removing names from the name pool however, will not remove the names from the databases(They will still be present on the grid).** Interactions with the name pool will not be tracked by undo/redo.
- Added option to start day 2 on 0700 hours. This will remove the column for 0600 (Only if no shift is allocated from 0600-0700 hrs)
- Added option to disable lunch and dinner checking.

## How to use

### Adding names to database
- Activate sidebar
- Select database to update. Type name into input widget
- Only one name can be added to each day. E.g. The same name cannot be added to Day1:MCC and Day1:HCC1 etc.
- **Names are formatted automatically to upper case, and without excess white space**

### Removing names from database
- From the multi select widget above the "remove" button, choose names to remove
- Click remove to remove name from database
- Make sure to select the appropriate database to remove from

### Allocating shift
- Access the main page
- Select the appropriate database from the radio buttons
- Select the name(s) from the database. You may select more than 1.
- **Ensure the appropriate locations are set.** If the location is the same as the database. A green box is shown. If the location is different, the location will be displayed in the corresponding time block also highlighted in green
- Shift sizes are allocated in either 30 min or 1h blocks
    -  First 30 min allocates xx00 - xx30 hrs
    - Last 30 min allocates xx30 to xy00 hrs
    - Full allocates xx00 - xy00 hrs

### Shift Checking algorithms
- Lunch/Dinner break checks
    - If someone is not allocated a lunch or dinner break. The name will be highlighted in <span style="color:red">RED</span>
    - Lunch break: **1130-1330 hrs** Dinner break: **1700-1830 hrs**
    - A person must be have at least a **30 min break** in the respective time periods for their name to not be highlighted
- Shift validation
    - At the bottom of the main page there are 3 columns Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3.
    - The validation activates only when all shifts are allocated I.e. Day 1: 56hrs allocated, Day 2: 60 hrs allocated, Day 3: 21hrs allocated.
    - validation checks that there are 2 people mounting in each control centre at the same time. And also at least 3 people for HOTO @ 0600-0700 on day 3.
- Allowing more than 4 mounting personnel at once
    - clicking the **ignore overallocation** checkbox allows for more than 4 mounting personnel in total (algorithm will not output a warning)
    - This allows for cases where new personnel are shadowing and are not counted as strength.
